Audio Preservation Schema
=========================

The Audio Preservation Schema element set is a set of metadata elements (classes and properties) designed to supply critical preservation information about a sound recording in order to further preserve and carefully digitize the sound recording. The elements in this schema are largely based on [FACET: Format Characteristics and Preservation Problems (pdf)](http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/projects/sounddirections/facet/facet_formats.pdf), written by Michael Casey.

The [display page](http://jacobshelby.org/schemas/aps/2014/08/03/apsSchema.html) was generated using this [XSL Transformation (xsl)](./apsSchema_transformation.xsl) and then styled with this [stylesheet (css)](./apsSchema.css). All HTML coding, with the exception of the introduction, is embedded in the XSL file. Because of this, any future changes to the schema can easily be translated over to the display page without manually updating the HTML code.
